    <h1>Welcome to tagtog</h1>
    <p>This is the official documentation for {% include inline-image.html name="icon_leafs.png" width="18" %}<a href="https://www.tagtog.com" title="tagtog.com - The Text Annotation Tool to Train AI">tagtog</a>, an efficient text annotation tool ready to train AI. Available on the Cloud and on-Premises. <strong>Easy</strong>.</p>
    <p>Below you can find a brief summary with the main features of tagtog and an overview of what you can achieve using this tool. For more in-depth information or tutorials, use the navigation to the left to explore our documentation.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>What can you achieve?</h2>
    <div class="page-section">
      <h3>Manual text annotation</h3>
      <p>Use the text annotation editor to quickly annotate and normalize entities (overlapping annotations supported), add entity labels, relations and <a title="tagtog-docs: type of annotations" href="/webeditor.html#annotation-types">more</a>. If you just need to annotate at document level, you can use labels to tag documents. The <strong>user interface adapts automatically so you only see what you need</strong>. No more complex or non-intuitive annotating systems/interfaces, engage your domain experts from the very beginning.</p>
      <p>Too much work for a single person? <a href="#team-collaboration">Invite others and work in group</a>. Each annotator can annotate the same text to facilitate the review process and to meet quality requirements. Once the annotations are completed, you can adjudicate, and export them to JSON format.</p>

      {% include image.html name="chatbot.png" caption="Building your custom annotation layout. Example of a conversation between a human and Facebook BlenderBot chatbot" %}
      <p>Do you need to deal with <strong>PDFs</strong>? {% include inline-image.html name="icon-pdf.png" width="30" %} Use the <a title="tagtog - PDF annotation tool" href="pdf-annotation-tool.html">PDF Annotation tool</a> to annotate native PDFs within tagtog.</p>
      {% include image.html name="pdf-annotation.jpg"  caption="Annotate PDF natively, as they are and the way your team is used to work with them " %}
      <h3>Automatic text annotation</h3>
      <p>Not fast enough? Use automatic annotations to speed up annotator tasks. Use pre-selections, <a href="projects.html#dictionaries">dictionaries</a>, <a href="machine-learning.html">tagtog ML</a> or plug <a href="train-your-own-models.html">your own ML model</a> in. Users will see the automatic annotations and just make an action when predictions are wrong. Powered by <strong>NLP</strong> algorithms, tagtog uses the corrections to improve accuracy and <strong>continuously reduce the load of annotators' work</strong>.</p>

        <p>Insights are just meta information (annotations) on the top of the text analyzed.

      <p class="numbered-item"><span class="number-2">2</span><strong>Train a model</strong>: import text (cloud or on-premises) through the <a href="/API_documents_v1.html">API</a> or the user interface.

      <p class="numbered-item"><span class="number-3">3</span><strong>Congratulations! You get a machine learning model ready for production use</strong>. Simply send text (or documents) to the API or user interface to retrieve relevant insights. If you detect any problem with the results, you can always continue annotating to fine tune the model.</p>

      <h2>The annotation editor</h2>
      <div class="two-third-col">
        <p>tagtog comes with an advanced text annotation tool for <strong>data augmentation</strong>. Its design is based on the feedback from annotation groups.</p>
        <p><strong>Focus</strong> is key in order to generate a high-quality annotated corpora, and we know this. Each single mistake in the annotations means a step backward and more effort to achieve the desired results. With this in mind and to make the user feel comfortable while reading, we have created a <strong>minimalist user interface</strong> where the text is presented with natural spacing, same as any user can be familiar with. By <strong>protecting the reading experience</strong> the tool is more accessible. This is specially important when you involve subject matter experts in your annotation projects.</p>
        <p>Usually annotation tasks involve dealing with big volumes of texts. <strong>Speed and efficiency</strong> are essential to minimize costs and time. tagtog includes features as automatic annotations, overlapping text annotations or full-text annotation, that reduce significantly the time required to annotate text.</p>
        <p>Do you need to annotate or process PDFs? Use the <a title="tagtog - PDF annotation tool" href="pdf-annotation-tool.html">PDF annotation tool</a>, it is fully integrated with tagtog web interface.</p>
        <p>With the annotation editor you can add different types of annotations:</p>
