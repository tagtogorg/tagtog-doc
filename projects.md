    <h3>Guidelines</h3>
    <p>You can write the <strong>annotation guidelines</strong> for you or your team. It should define what and how to manually annotate. The more clear it is, the better the annotations and the training data you can generate.</p>

    <h3>Entities</h3>
    <p>Here you should define what type of information you want to annotate manually or automatically. Meaning, which type of information you want to identify or annotate in text. You achieve this by defining <code>Entity Types</code> (a.k.a. Entity Classes).</p>
    {% include image.html name="settings-entities-types.PNG" caption="You define entity types from the user interface"%}
  </div>
  <div class="one-third-col">
    <div class="message">
      <strong>What is an entity?</strong>&nbsp; a named entity is a real-world object, such as persons, locations, organizations, products, etc. Examples of named entities include Barack Obama, New York City, Volkswagen Golf, or anything that can be named. Entities are instances of <code>Entity Types</code> (e.g., New York City is an instance of a City, wheel is an instance of a Vehicle part).
    </div>
    <div class="message">
      <strong>Accessibility tip</strong>: use colors that are easy to distinguish. Keep in mind color blind users.
    </div>
    <div class="message">
      The name for an Entity type should contain only letters, numbers, or underscores, and must start with a letter. Minimum length: 2 characters. Maximum length: 24 characters.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="two-third-col">
    <p>You must add one or more entity types. Each entity is defined by a <code>name</code>, <code>description</code> (optional) and <code>color</code>. For example in the project in the picture above we want to extract vehicle information and for that we have created entity types to annotate vehicle parts (<code>vehiclePart</code>), vehicle types, (<code>vehicleType</code>) and vehicle model (<code>vehicleModel</code>). In order to easily identify the entities in the text, we will assign to each entity type a color.</p>

    <h3>Dictionaries</h3>
    <p>As soon as you create one entity type, this will appear in the <code>Dictionaries</code> panel. Each entity type can have associated one or more dictionaries (<a href="/dictionary-format.html">Dictionary format</a>). From here you can upload, replace or download dictionaries.</p>
    {% include image.html name="settings-dictionaries.PNG" caption="Once you have created a dictionary, you can upload/replace or download the dictionary file"%}
    <p>As an example of dictionary, let's use the entity type <code>vehicleModel</code>. For example, <code>Volkswagen Golf 7</code>, <code>Golf Mk7</code> and <code>Golf VII</code> all identify the same canonical or unique object, this object can be identified with an ID, e.g.: <code>VWGOLF7</code>. Let's create our entry in the dictionary:</p>
    <div class="highlight">
      VWGOLF7&emsp;Volkswagen Golf 7&emsp;Golf Mk7&emsp;Golf VII
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="one-third-col">
    <div class="message">
      <strong>What is a dictionary?</strong> A simple list of terms with their synonyms. E.g. the model <code>Volkswagen Golf 7</code> is also known as <code>Golf Mk7</code>. This list facilitates NER, i.e. the <strong>automatic extraction of entities</strong> in text and their normalization. <strong>Entity normalization (also called Entity Linking or Entity Disambiguation)</strong> means identifing the canonical, <em>unambiguous</em> reference of the entity. <a href="/dictionary-format.html">Dictionary format</a>.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="two-third-col">
    <p>When you create a dictionary, you don't need to cover cases as plural, tenses, etc. tagtog uses the dictionary entries and applies <strong>grammar rules</strong> to identify potential entities doing such modifications for you.</p>
    <p>In order to upload a dictionary, you first need to create a dictionary. Click on <code>New Dictionary</code> under the entity type name and Save it. Two options will show up: <code>Download Dictionary</code> and <code>Upload Dictionary</code>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="one-third-col">
    {% include message.html message="The process of normalization <strong>facilitates the retrieval of information</strong>, e.g. How many error reports mention the vehicle <code>Golf Mk7</code>?" %}

  <div class="two-third-col">
  <p><strong>Upload/Replace</strong>: you can use this option to upload a dictionary file. If the file was uploaded previously, it will be replaced with the new dictionary. Once you uploaded a dictionary, all new text imported is annotated automatically following the dictionary rules.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="one-third-col">
  </div>
  <div class="two-third-col">
    <p><strong>Download</strong>: you can use this option to download the dictionary being used in tagtog to your computer. This is very useful to make large edit operations and later replace the existing dictionary.</p>
    <p>Dictionaries are <strong>automatically updated</strong> if a user adds new normalizations using the web editor. <a href="/webeditor.html#update-dictionary-from-annotation-editor">More information</a>.</p>

    <h3>Relations</h3>
    <p>You can <strong> annotate relations</strong> in text. For that you must first create a new <code>Relation Type</code> by clicking the <code>New Relation Type</code> button. After just choose two Entity Types, those types you want to identify relations for. Optionally you can add a <code>description</code> for the relation. For example, a new relation type between vehicle parts and vehicle models.</p>

    <h3>Webhooks</h3>
    <h4>What is a webhook?</h4>
    <p>A webhook is a notification mechanism that allows your system to receive events from a different service in real-time. Event notifications are sent via HTTP POST requests to an endpoint defined by you.</p>
    <p>Think of it as an SMS notification. You make a change to your bank account details (event), and you receive an SMS asking you for confirmation (event notification). When you opened your bank account, you gave your phone number (endpoint), so they know how to reach you.</p>
    <h4>Webhooks in tagtog</h4>
    <p>The webhooks are useful to integrate your system or models with tagtog. You can define webhooks to notify automatically an external system right after a specific action was performed using tagtog GUI or API.</p>
    <p>Only users with the role <code>admin</code> (or a custom role with enough <a href="collaboration.html#permissions" title="tagtog - Permissions">permissions</a>) can see/edit these project settings.</p>
    <p>In tagtog, there are two events that trigger an event notification:</p>
    <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-1"></span>Import new document: an event notification is sent once a user uploads a document. Use this notification, for example, to annotate the document using your models and push the annotated document back to tagtog.</p>
    <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-2"></span>Save a document: an event notification is sent once a user saves a document. Use this notification, for example, to get the annotations done by your team and add them to your training data.</p>
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr>
        <th>Event</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Source</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Import new document</td>
        <td>A notification is sent when the user uploads a document.</td>

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>When any of those events are triggered, we'll send a <strong>HTTP POST payload</strong> to the webhook's configured End Point URL.</p>
    <p>We also send information in the delivery <strong>HTTP headers</strong> for you to better process the event:</p>
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr>
        <th>Header</th>
        <th>Description</th>

For example, if you choose 2 annotators, every uploaded document will be randomly allocated to 2 annotators; that is, every document will have to be annotated by at least 2 annotators. You can choose between different flows to annotate documents in your team. Find <a title="tagtog - Annotation flows" href="collaboration.html#annotation-flows">here</a> the options.</p>

    <p markdown="1">Annotating the same document by 2 or more members is recommended to increase the overall **quality of your annotation project**. By using it, tagtog compares the annotations from different annotators to calculate their level of agreement (<a title="tagtog - Inter-annotator agreement" href="collaboration#iaa-inter-annotator-agreement">inter-annotator agreement</a> or IAA) automatically, a good indicator of quality. For more information about quality management at tagtog, go <a title="tagtog - Quality Management" href="collaboration.html#quality-management">here</a>.</p>

    {% include image.html name="settings/members-task-distribution.png" width="85%" caption="Task Distribution: assign documents to your labelers as soon they are uploaded." %}

    <p>To start task distribution, first you need to enable the feature. Then:</p>
    <p class="numbered-item"><span class="number-1">1</span><strong>Select the members you want to distribute documents to</strong> (the system only distributes documents to these users).</p>
    <p class="numbered-item"><span class="number-2">2</span><strong>Select the number of annotators per document</strong> (how many of the selected users will annotate each document).</p>
    <br>
    <p>To keep track of the project quality, even if you set the task distribution as one annotator per document (each document is assigned to a different annotator), tagtog automatically tries to allocate 5% of your documents to two annotators to calculate IAA.</p>
    <p><strong>By default, task distribution is turned off</strong>. This means that uploaded documents do not get distributed.</p>
    <p>You can find below the differences between a project with task distribution active or not:</p>

## Downloads

Your project has also a tab _"Downloads"_ to... download stuff 😉. Depending on your role in the project, and whether the project is public or private, you will see different actionable buttons.

In particular, with the button `Download All Documents (and their annotations)` you can **download as a Zip file** all your project's documents and their annotations (in [anndoc format](anndoc)). This button is available only to project admins in private projects. It is available to all logged-in users in public projects. Moreover, an analogous button `Download as Zip` is present in all document searches and folders (_"Documents"_ tab) to download as Zip the subset of documents that match the search.

In this section, you can also download a CSV file with the annotation status of your documents. This report lists in one column the document ids and in a second column the status of their `master` version (`true` if confirmed, `false` if not confirmed).

Other download actions are also available, including a reference to [download documents using the API](API_documents_v1), and [exporting the annotations legend](API_settings_v1.html#annotations-legend).

  <h2>Privacy</h2>
  <p>Projects in tagtog are either public or private. You can change your private project to public or your public project to private in the <a href="projects.html#admin" title="tagtog - Admin settings">Admin Settings</a> of your project.</p>
  <h3>Public projects</h3>
  <p>Public projects {% include inline-image.html name="globe.png" width="20" %} are <strong>open projects</strong>. Share your data with the entire world (Cloud) or across your organization (OnPremises). Give to your dataset <strong>transparency and visibility</strong>. It is also a good opportunity to attract other people to collaborate with you to build or maintain open datasets. In public projects: </p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-1"></span>Anyone can see its documents and annotations (read-only).</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-2"></span>Only registered users can download documents or annotations using the UI or the <a href="API_documents_v1.html" title="tagtog - API docs">API</a>.</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-3"></span>Only the project members can make changes.</p>
  <h3>Private projects</h3>
  <p>In private projects {% include inline-image.html name="lock.png" width="20" %}, documents and annotations are kept private:</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-1"></span>Each private project is only visible to its members.</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-2"></span>Only project members can make changes.</p>
