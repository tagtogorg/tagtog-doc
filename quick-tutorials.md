  <h2><a title="tagtog at Medium - Build powerful annotation layouts with tagtog blocks" href="https://medium.com/@tagtog/build-powerful-annotation-layouts-with-tagtog-blocks-5ae2a1268917">Build powerful annotation layouts with tagtog blocks</a></h2>
  <p>As part of the flavored Markdown used in tagtog, you can create blocks with custom styles/layout. As we all know, annotating data can be a tedious task, and a more attractive content can be key to keep your team engaged. Using Markdown you can use the new tagtog blocks to build a customized annotation layout for your project! E.g. question answering datasets, chatbot training, tweets, etc.</p>

  <p>If multiple annotators work on the same data, as a result, there are multiple annotation versions. We define adjudication as the process to resolve inconsistencies among these versions before a version is promoted to the gold standard. This process is manual, semi-automatic or automatic. Learn the differences and when to use each of them.</p>
