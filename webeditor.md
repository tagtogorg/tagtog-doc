    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The core of tagtog the text annotation editor for data augmentation. This editor is designed to make the user feel comfortable annotating text. We have created a minimalist user interface to interfere as little as possible in the reading experience to increase annotator's focus and the efficiency during annotation tasks.</p>
    <p>The annotation editor is used to <strong>manually annotate text</strong> or/and <strong>train a machine learning model to automatically annotate text</strong>. By enabling automatic annotations you can build <a href="/#what-can-you-achieve">awesome stuff</a> you didn't think of at first.</p>
    <p>This web editor includes features as automatic annotations, <a href="https://medium.com/@tagtog/overlapping-text-annotations-19d7ac5b247a" title="Medium - Overlapping text annotations, gain flexibility">overlapping text annotations</a> or support for full-text articles, that reduce significantly the time required to annotate text.</p>

      The editor is part of a <strong>web app</strong>. You don't need anything than a web browser to use it. If you are using an <strong>on-premises</strong> version, contact the internal administrator of the application to understand how to access the app. If you are using the <strong>Cloud</strong> version, just go to <a href="https://tagtog.com">tagtog.com</a>.

      By protecting the reading experience the tool is more accessible. This is specially important when you involve <strong>subject matter experts</strong> in your annotation projects.

    <h2>Annotation types</h2>
    <p>You can annotate at text span level or at document level. Let's take a look to the type of annotations you can create using tagtog:</p>
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr>
        <th>Annotation type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Entity</td>
        <td>Span of text representing a named entity. <strong>It can be any span</strong>: a part of a word, a word, a sentence or a group of words. Each entity belongs to one or more entity classes (e.g. Barack Obama is <code>person</code> and <code>politic</code>). Overlapped annotations are supported. <a href="#create-new-text-annotations">More</a>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Normalization</td>
        <td>Id assigned to a named entity. These annotations help in <strong>disambiguation</strong> (<strong>entity linking</strong>). Normalization or canonicalization is the process for assigning an id or unique name to data that has more than one possible representation. This process is supported by <a href="/projects.html#dictionaries">dictionaries</a>. For example an <code>air filter</code> in automotive can make reference to a <code>cabin air filter</code> or an <code>engine air filter</code>. With tagtog you can assign the correct reference to the entity. Each entity can have assigned one or more Ids (e.g. Id from Wikipedia, and an Id from your internal database).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Entity label</td>
        <td><p><strong>Label (<code>boolean</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>enum</code>) assigned to a named entity</strong>. Each entity can have assigned one or more labels.</p>
        <p>Let's say you are extracting technical issues from reports in a CRM. When annotating those reports, you can add extra information to those entities (technical issues), for example severity. You can use this metadata to build a statistical model that retrieves the severity given a particular technical issue in a specific context.</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Relation</td>
        <td><p>Relation <strong>between two named entities</strong>. Each relation belong to one specific relation type (e.g. BRCA2 <code>gene</code> is located <code>is_located</code> on the chromosome 13 <code>location</code>).</p>
        <p>Currently tagtog supports bidirectional relationships (A relates to B, and B relates to A) to connect two entities. If you want to connect more than two entities you need to create more than one relation.</p>
        <p>In order to set or see relations, remember you need first to define at least one Relation Type in <i>Settings > Relations</i>. Otherwise the option to See or Add relations in the menu will be disabled.</p>
        <p>Relations are supported between entities from different paragraphs or sections.</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Document label</td>
        <td><p>Label (<code>boolean</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>enum</code>) assigned to a document or text. One or more labels can be assigned to a document. These annotations help in <strong>text or intent classification</strong>.</p>
        <p>For example, if you are classifying emails in order to dispatch them to different departments, you can create a document label (enum) and classify emails as, for example, <code>sales</code>, <code>technical support</code> or <code>legal</code>. You can use the labeled data to train a text classifier model and classify emails automatically.</p></td>

      <p>The text is displayed in the document area. There you can read and annotate text.</p>
      <h4>Text annotations</h4>
      <p>Once a piece of text is annotated, it becomes an entity. In tagtog you can operate with entities and do things as normalize them, relate them, etc.</p>
      <p>The background color of each annotation depends on the color picked for the Entity Type. The font color changes based on the background color so the contrast is appropriate to read.</p>

      <h5>Create new text annotations</h5>
      <p>A new text annotation is created by <strong>highlighting text with the mouse</strong>. Position the cursor at the beginning of the text you want to highlight. Press and hold your primary mouse button (commonly the left-button). While holding the mouse button, drag the cursor to the end of the text and let go of the mouse button. Once completed, all the text from the beginning to the end should be highlighted using the same Entity Type used in the previous text annotation. Currently the only way to change the entity type used for new annotations is by first changing the entity type of existing annotation.</p>
      <p><strong>Tips & tricks</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you <strong>double-click</strong>, you annotate the word clicked.</li>
        <li>If you try to annotate a word that starts or ends in <i>space</i>, the <strong>space</strong> won't be annotated.</li>
        <li>Press and hold the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>command</kbd> key to <strong>annotate a whole paragraph</strong>. Simply hold the key and click on the paragraph to annotate it.</li>

      <p>Automatic annotations created upon the manual creation or removal of other <strong>equal annotation</strong> (same entity type and same text).
