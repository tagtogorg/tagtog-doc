  <h2>What are tagtog blocks?</h2>
  <p>As part of the <a href="MarkdownFileParsing">flavored Markdown used in tagtog</a>, you can create blocks with <strong>custom styles/layout</strong>. As we all know, annotating data can be a tedious task, and a <strong>more attractive content</strong> can be key to keep your team engaged.</p>
</div>
<div class="one-third-col">
</div>

<div class="two-third-col">
  <h2>How to use tagtog blocks?</h2>
  <p>You can add blocks to your content in two ways:</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-1"></span>Import to your project a <strong><code>.md</code> (Markdown) file</strong> with one or more tagtog blocks. You can use the <a href="API_documents_v1.html#examples-import-a-markdown-file">API</a> or the <a href="documents.html#upload-content">GUI</a>.</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-2"></span>Copy or write the blocks <strong>directly in the <a href="documents.html#upload-content">+Content</a> menu</strong> and set the format as Markdown in the advanced options.</p>
  <p>tagtog blocks are Markdown code blocks. For example, you can add a textbox code block as follows:</p>
  <div markdown="1">
    ```textbox
    Hello, I'm a textbox block.
    ```
  </div>

</div>
<div class="one-third-col">
</div>
<div class="two-third-col">
  <h2>Block types</h2>
  <h3>Text box</h3>
  <p>Code: <code>textbox</code></p>
  <p>This block draws a circled box around the content.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>

  <div markdown="1">
    ```textbox
    In the U.S. federal health care system (including the VA, the Indian Health Service, and NIH) ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority. In some states such North Carolina and New Mexico these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority. In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification.

    The official designation for pharmacists who pass the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist and these pharmacists will carry the initials BCACP.

  <h3>Chatbot</h3>
  <p>If you combine this layout with the tagtog annotation capabilities, you could perform chatbot annotation tasks such as:</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-1"></span>Entity annotation</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-2"></span>Intent classification</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-3"></span>Create relations between entities</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-4"></span>Attach attributes to entities</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-5"></span>Context classification</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-6"></span>Overlapping annotations (e.g. entity within intent)</p>
</div>
<div class="two-third-col">
  <h4>Bot</h4>
  <p>Code: <code>bot</code></p>

    ```
    ```human
    I love it! it's very important to protect the environment.
    ```
    ```bot
    That's great! Do you have any hobbies? I like to play tennis in my spare time.
    ```
    ```human
    I'm not very coordinated so I don't play sports… I do like to play the guitar, though!
    ```
    ```bot
    That's awesome! I've always wanted to learn how to play an instrument. What kind of music do you play?
    ```
    ```human
    Mostly alternative rock!
    ```
    ```bot
    That's cool! I like alternative rock as well. What are some of your favorite bands?

  <h3>Tasks</h3>
  <p>Specially at the beginning of an annotation project, it is important to guide the annotator through the whole annotation flow. Usually, a set of guidelines are put together, annotators read through them and they try to label some documents following these rules. Why not to combine theory and practice?</p>
  <p>Code: <code>task</code></p>
  <p>Block to define a task for the annotators.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <div markdown="1">
    ## Interactive guidelines

    Welcome to the interactive guidelines for our medical annotation project.

    #### Basic rules:

    * The annotator must select the concept codes that better cover the meaning of the clinical concept.
    * The annotator must select the fewest number of codes that, together, better covers the meaning of the clinical concept.
    * If there is a doubt, don't annotate.

    #### Example

    ```textbox
    Complicated fracture of third rib
    ```

    This text could be annotated with the following codes:
    1. |255302009| Complicated.
    2. |706922007| Complicated fracture of bone.
    3. |125605004| Fracture of bone. If annotators are more literal this code could be full coverage. However, other could see the next code as more appropriate and also use the score "inferred coverage".
    4. |20274005|   Fracture of one rib.
    5. |25888004|   Bone structure of third rib (body structure).

    ```task
    Explore the different combinations below, click on each annotated entity and see which codes were assigned to it.
    ```

    1,3,5
    ```textbox
    Complicated fracture of third rib
    ```
    2,5
    ```textbox
    Complicated fracture of third rib
    ```
    This would be the best annotation group, because it has a fully coverage and it also has a fewer number of codes
    #### Your task
    ```task
    Now it is your turn! Annotate this sentence to fully cover its content.
    ```
    ```textbox
    other complications of unspecified head injuries
    ```

  <h3>Meta information</h3>
  <p>Sometimes you need to add meta information to other blocks or parts of your document. This contextual information might be important for the annotation task. For example: timestamps, specific ids, etc. or any other piece of information associated to the block. </p>
  <p markdown="1">Meta blocks are not explicitly linked to other blocks, they are stand alone blocks. Therefore, meta blocks won't auto align with the blocks they refer to.</p>
  <p markdown="1">This block is not annotatable, and users cannot create any manual annotations.</p>
  <p>Code: <code>meta</code></p>
  <p>Block to define meta information.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <div markdown="1">
    ```meta left
    12/11/2020 14:44:30
    ```
    ```human
    Good morning. I cannot login to my account. I see a connection error. Is your site down?

    Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya

  <h3>Not annotatable</h3>
  <p>This add-on marks a block as not annotatable. This is useful if you don't want annotators to annotate specific parts of your document (e.g. tasks or information for annotators). Manual annotation is not possible for blocks with this add-on.</p>
  <p markdown="1">Code: `no-annotatable`</p>
  <p>Example:</p>
  <div markdown="1">
    ```task no-annotatable
    Please annotate the law provisions
    ```
    ```textbox
    The obligation to comply with European legislation derives ultimately from membership of the European Union. However, European Directives may be transposed into domestic law in different ways. This is well illustrated by the European Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts (93/13 EEC). The first attempt to implement the Directive in domestic law showed a distinct lack of imagination, using the ‘copy out’ technique. The provisions of the Directive were simply repeated, mostly verbatim, in a statutory instrument: the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994 (SI 1994/ 3159). The ‘copy out’ approach creates many problems as there is no attempt to integrate the measure with the existing domestic law on the subject.  These issues of integration were not addressed when the 1994 Regulations were replaced by a new statutory instrument with the same name but a different date in 1999 (SI 1999/2083).

  <p markdown="1">Codes: `col-*`</p>
  <p class="list-item" markdown="1"><span class="list-item-1"></span>`col-6`: for **two-column layout**. Each block takes up 6 grid columns. 2 blocks will require the whole 12 (6*2) grid columns.</p>
  <p class="list-item" markdown="1"><span class="list-item-2"></span>`col-4`: for **three-column layout**. Each block takes up 4 grid columns. 3 blocks will require the whole 12 (4*3) grid columns.</p>

    The law would instantly transform all martial arts instructors into criminal felons. This includes instructors who teach kickboxing, BJJ, Krav Maga, boxing and even Capoeira.

    It would also criminalize all firearms training classes, including concealed carry classes. It would even criminalize a father teaching his own son how to use a hunting rifle.

    Specifically, the law says that a person “is guilty of unlawful paramilitary activity” (a class 5 felony) if that person:
    “Assembles with one or more persons for the purpose of training with, practicing with, or being instructed in the use of any firearm, explosive, or incendiary device, or technique capable of causing injury or death to persons…”

    The phrase “technique capable of causing injury or death to persons” covers all forms of martial arts and self-defense training, including Krav Maga, BJJ, boxing and other contact martial arts such as Tae Kwon Do or Tai Chi.

    Under the proposed law, all forms of self-defense training, including hand-to-hand martial arts training, would be considered “paramilitary activity,” even if the training consists of private classes involving just one instructor and one student. That’s because every form of martial arts training imparts skills which could be used to cause injury to other persons.

    In fact, according to the language of the law, just “one” person learning such arts is a felony crime, which means that watching a DVD on Krav Maga would be a felony crime.

    ## Fake news detection: identifying fake news

    1. Is the story unbelievable?
        If it’s so incredible that you cannot believe it, you shouldn’t.  Alternatively, if is confirms your worst nightmares, you should research it deeper to find supporting or contradictory evidence.

    2. Does the story match the headline?
        This is an example of clickbait used to pass biased or fake news to unsuspecting readers.

    3. What is the timing of the story?
        If the article is describing things that will happen, you should be skeptical.  You should also double-check that this isn’t an old story.  Many sites take stories or pictures from a few years ago and revamp them to fit in with a headline from a current date.

    4. Is the story attacking a generic enemy?
        Good reporting will not make generalizations and will be specific about who they are criticizing.  Be skeptical for vague references, such as the left or Washington.

    5. Is there only one incredible fact?
        If the story tries to prove or disprove something  based on only one encompassing fact, treat it as a warning sign.  Look for supporting evidence and links to reputable news outlets.

    6. Who is accountable for this information?
        All media is vulnerable to mistaken facts and news.  However, reputable news sources take accountability for their stories.  Biased and fake news outlets often do not take the same steps towards accountability, even going as far as giving fake contact information.

    <h2>Caveats</h2>
    <p class="list-item" markdown="1"><span class="list-item-1"></span>tagtog blocks cannot be nested within each other. For example, you cannot create a `task` block inside a `textbox` block.</p>
    <p class="list-item" markdown="1"><span class="list-item-2"></span>While you can combine any tagtog block or add-ons together (e.g. `task` + `question left warning` + `textbox right`), be aware that some of these have a predefined style that might conflict visually with other blocks.</p>
